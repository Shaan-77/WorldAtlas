## üåç WorldAtlas ‚Äì A React-Based Country Discovery Application

Country Explorer is a beautifully designed frontend web application developed using React.js, allowing users to discover and explore countries from around the world. The project integrates with an external REST API to dynamically fetch and display detailed information about each country, including its history, culture, and regional highlights.

This project was built as part of my learning journey to strengthen my skills in frontend development, API integration, and responsive UI design. It demonstrates proficiency in:

Fetching and managing external data using asynchronous requests

Implementing client-side routing with React Router

Designing clean, user-friendly interfaces with a focus on aesthetics and usability

From searching countries to exploring rich details about each region, Country Explorer offers an engaging experience while showcasing essential frontend development concepts in a real-world context.
